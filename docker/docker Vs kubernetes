Docker containers is ephemeral nature(short lived)
Docker does not support service discovery which means 
if container goes down, and we started again the container, and other depended container didn't discover this started container because the IP address was changed.
and also docker didn't support the few things:
  1. Service discovery
  2. high availability
  3. load balancing
  4. API gateway
