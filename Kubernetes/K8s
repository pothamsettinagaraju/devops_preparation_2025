Kubernetes two important resources

1. Deployment - Scalling and Healing: Deployment will create a replica set to maintain container always scalling and healing
2. Service - Service discovery: When container or pod goes down, that time this service works like a proxy to get new IP address of the container by using labels and selectos.
3. service account - K8s provides service account to k8s

service types:

1. ClusterIP: resource is accessable within the clusterIP
2. NodePort: resource is accessable with in the VPC
3. LoadBalancer: resource is accessable to external world, if we are using AWS, it will create VPC
we use above service types in service.yml file
